# Force Disable Easter Eggs

This is a Minecraft mod for Quilt (/Fabric) to disable easter eggs that do not have an explicit option or setting to disable them.

Currently, the following easter eggs are disabled:

- Halloween splash text
- Christmas splash text
- New year splash text
- Christmas present texture for chests

Licensed under MIT, not all easter eggs are caught yet.
